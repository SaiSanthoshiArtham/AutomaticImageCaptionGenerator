Image Captioning, an Artificial Intelligence based application.This application can be used to generate the natural language description of the image.This application can be build using a hybrid neural network architecture using convolution and recurrent layers to capture the inherent features from Image and generate the text.

Concepts of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence is been used in many applications to make models to learn from the data. In this project we are building hybrid neural network architecture to learn the features from multi model input such as Image and Text data. Convolution Layers of network learn features from images and recurrent layers learn from text data. The trained network can be used to predict and generate the caption for the unseen images.
